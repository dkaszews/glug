# Note: `src/**.cpp` files might be analyzed twice, once for each target
# Explain every exclusion here, since cannot comment in middle of block scalar
# * google-readability-avoid-underscore-in-googletest-name:
#   Incompatible with snake_case naming convention
# * modernize-use-trailing-return-type:
#   Might consider in future, limit refactor for now
# * portability-avoid-pragma-once:
#   Supported by all serious compilers
# * readability-identifier-length:
#   Short does not mean non-descriptive, like `string_view s` or `to = from`,
#   coding in all those exceptions is a waste of time
# * misc-no-recursion:
#   Recursion is a valid tool, often only tool to get the job done
# * readability-redundant-member-init:
#   All members should be explicitly value-initialized for consistency,
#   as it is not guaranteed that default initialization is sane, like primitives
# * readability-static-accessed-through-instance:
#   `s.npos` is much shorter and more readable than `std::string_view::npos`
#
# TODO: Fix third group, static or recursion are to be comment-ignored
